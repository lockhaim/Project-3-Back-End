# Project-3-Back-End

This is a full CRUD react app done by Kevin Trang and myself, using the 7 restful routes.

Kevin and I started off by deciding what we wanted to accomplish with out third project. We decided that using react to create a Single-Page application something like a recipe app would be something interesting to see.

We started off creating the back end, and used a number of technologies similar to what we did in our unit 2 projects including:

Express,
Mongoose,
CORS,
Axios,
DotENV,
POSTman

Express is used as the basic JS framework.

The backend database is a simple database MongoDB using mongoose to interface with the front end.

CORS is used so that we are able to send the correct access control headers so that the API calls we are making on the front end are able to be got.

DotENV is used to control the environmental variables so that we can accurately deploy.

Axios is used to make the required HTML methods (GET, PUT, POST, etc).

Initially we struggled getting our backend to deploy correctly to Heroku because we had not set the environmental variables in Heroku. After setting up the variables correctly it was relatively straight forward to set up the back end with JSON create, read, update, and delete methods, and used POSTman to test the back end.

It was really great working with Kevin on this project. I learned a lot from him about how to use POSTman to test the backend, and even more in the front end. It was good to watch how a peer of mine approached this set of problems and solved bugs.
